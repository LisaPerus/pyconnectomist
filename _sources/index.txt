pyConnectomist
==============

Python wrappers for Connectomist: wrap the Connectomist software and simplify
scripting calls. Each preprocessing, tractography and labeling step (i.e. one
Connectomist tab) can be run through the use of a dedicated function of the
package.

pyConnectomist, developed by the NeuroSpin software platform, is a wrapping of
the Connectomist software developped by the `UNIRS team
<http://i2bm.cea.fr/drf/i2bm/Pages/NeuroSpin/UNIRS/Presentation.aspx>`.
It is meant to be run as part of a research collaboration or a charged
service. For more information about its terms of use, please contact Cyril
Poupon and Vincent Frouin.
